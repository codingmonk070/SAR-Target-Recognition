# SAR-Target-Recognition
Two-Stream CNN for SAR Target Recognition Implemented a Two-Stream CNN on the MSTAR-10 dataset for SAR target recognition. The model uses bilateral filtering for noise suppression and achieves 98.10% accuracy with a lightweight architecture, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.
